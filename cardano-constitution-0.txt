# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM INTERIM CONSTITUTION

### INTRODUCTORY NOTES

This is an interim minimum viable constitution containing such provisions
and guardrails as are necessary for CIP-1694 to come into effect.
It is intended to be temporary.
The Final Constitution must be ratified by Ada holders.
Such ratification is expected to occur at the end of 2024 or the beginning
of 2025.
Therefore, the Final Constitution may differ, potentially significantly,
from this Interim Constitution based on the desires of the Cardano community.
During 2024, a series of workshops will be held all around the world
allowing the Cardano community to participate in the process of
completing the Final Constitution.
Additionally, the Final Constitution will require the approval of Ada holders
before coming into effect.
Such approval is expected to occur in the beginning of 2025.
However, given that on-chain governance will come into existence during 2024,
requiring a robust constitution and constitutional committee before the
Final Constitution has been ratified, this Interim Constitution must contain
such provisions and guardrails as are necessary to support and give effect to
the needs and requirements of CIP-1694, assuring that the principles
identified in this Interim Constitution are not compromised,
until the date on which the Final Constitution is ratified.

In approaching this Interim Constitution, it must be remembered that this is not
a constitution for only a blockchain but rather, it is a constitution
for a blockchain ecosystem â€“ a much more ambitious endeavor.
Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important,
is not the sole focus of this Interim Constitution.
Rather, this Interim Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework
through which all actors in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem can come together
to govern themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction
and collaboration.
By necessity, this Interim Constitution recognizes the role of
and empowers the Constitutional Committee, confirms the right of the
Cardano community to participate in collective bodies for collaboration,
gives effect to on-chain governance, and empowers delegated representatives
(referred to as DReps) to act as the voice of Ada holders for on-chain voting.
The Interim Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to
and the use of funds of the Cardano treasury during an interim period
through the inclusion of the Cardano Guardrails in this Interim Constitution.

### PREAMBLE

In the beginning of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, three pioneering entities,
IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, came together to foster the emergence
of a new blockchain, the Cardano Blockchain, laying the foundation for
a decentralized network that would empower individuals,
and promote collaboration and innovation.
Their pioneering efforts have shaped the path for a blockchain
designed to ensure a fair and transparent environment where all participants
can contribute to the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem's growth and success.

Over time, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem has expanded significantly, and now,
the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, comprising of thousands of Ada holders,
individuals, builders, developers, enterprises, stake pools,
users of the Cardano Blockchain and others,
operates in a truly decentralized manner, further strengthening the resilience
and autonomy of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.
As the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem continues to grow, it has become imperative
to similarly adapt and evolve its governance model, reflecting the principles
of decentralization, community involvement, inclusivity and collaboration that
have been the cornerstone of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem since its start.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework,
and one that utilizes wherever possible and beneficial blockchain technology
in the governance process, the Cardano community, as the members of
this decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, hereby establishes this
Cardano Interim Constitution.
It shall serve as a guiding set of principles for the operation and
governance of our collective efforts, fostering an environment where all
participants can contribute to the betterment of the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

Together, the Cardano community commits to uphold the principles in this
Interim Constitution and to work together towards the continuous improvement,
growth, and success of our decentralized blockchain ecosystem known as
the Cardano Blockchain.

This Interim Constitution shall serve as the embodiment of the
guiding principles for the operation and governance of the
decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, providing a foundation that will
adapt and evolve over time to meet the continuing needs
of the Cardano community.
All members of the Cardano community are expected to abide by this
Interim Constitution, and are entitled to participate in its
governance processes, including completing a Final Constitution to be ratified
by Ada holders, and are encouraged to work collaboratively towards
the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem as a whole,
contributing to its growth, sustainability, and success.

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

### 1 INTRODUCTION

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance pursuant to CIP-1694,
it is necessary to establish sensible guardrails that will enable the
Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain
on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters
and limits on treasury withdrawals.
These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings,
and recommendations that are based on experience, measurement
and governance objectives.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of
the Cardano Blockchain.
They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid
potential problems with security, performance or functionality.
As described below, some of these guardrails are automatable and will be
enforced via an on-chain script or built-in ledger rules.

These guardrails apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment.
They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains
that use the Cardano Blockchain software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently.
Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way.
Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.

While the guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of
technical insight, this Appendix should be treated as a living document.
Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results
for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these
guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumstances, require them to be
tightened) in due course.
Additional guardrails may also be needed where, for example,
new protocol parameters are introduced.
The guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time
pursuant to an on-chain governance action that satisfies the applicable
voting threshold.
Any such amendment to any guardrails shall require and be deemed to be
an amendment to the Constitution itself.

#### Terminology and Guidance

**Should/Should not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value "should not"
be set below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a
recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion
or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano community
in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the
operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

**Must/Must not.**  Where this Appendix says that a value "must not" be set
below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that
will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in
mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a
protocol failure, security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level
performance evaluation that is designed to show a-priori that, for example,
95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain
nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases.
This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a
large test network of Cardano nodes,
simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network.

**Performance analysis.**  Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical
performance, empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual
system behavior.
For example, performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test
environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking
properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real
Cardano Blockchain network environment.

**Simulation.**  Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to
inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way.
For example, the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the
networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way,
allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.

**Performance Monitoring.**  Performance monitoring involves measuring the
actual behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network, for example,
by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times,
or test blocks to assess overall network health.
It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information
about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads
or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.**  Where performance monitoring shows that actual
network behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance
requirements for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its
previous state if that is possible.
For example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of
blocks are no longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert
the block size to 100KB.
If this is not possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that
will ensure that the performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.**  Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are
classified by severity level, where:

- Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the
security, performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network
- Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the
security, performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network
- Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security,
performance or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network

**Future Performance Requirements.** Planned development such as new mechanisms
for out-of-memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times.
When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future performance
requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain.
Until development is complete, the requirements will be
conservative; they may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when an
**New Constitution or Guardrails Script** governance action is enacted.
It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types,
filtering non-compliant governance actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

- **Parameter Update** actions, and
- **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is
submitted on-chain.
This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent
the chain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock.
There are three different situations that apply to script usage.

**Symbol and Explanation**

- (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the
reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails
will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document,
then the script **must not** permit any changes to the parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document
but no checkable guardrails are specified, the script **must not** impose any
constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable
protocol parameter settings via the protocol parameter update governance action
such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as
a result of such changes.

Note that there are at least five different sources of parameter names,
and these are not always consistent:

1. The name used in the Genesis file
2. The name used in protocol parameter update governance actions
3. The name used internally in ledger rules
4. The name used in the formal ledger specification
5. The name used in research papers

Where these parameter names differ, this Appendix uses the second convention.

###### Guardrails

PARAM-01 (y)  Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this
document **must not** be changed by a Parameter update governance action

PARAM-02 (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document
but no checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script **must not**
impose any constraints on changes to the parameter.
Checkable guardrails are shown by a (y)

#### 2.1 Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain

- *maximum block body size* (*maxBlockBodySize*)
- *maximum transaction size* (*maxTxSize*)
- *maximum block header size* (*maxBlockHeaderSize*)
- *maximum size of a serialized asset value* (*maxValueSize*)
- *maximum script execution/memory units in a single block*
(*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]*)
- *minimum fee coefficient* (*txFeePerByte*)
- *minimum fee constant* (*txFeeFixed*)
- *minimum fee per byte for reference scripts* (*minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte*)
- *minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (*utxoCostPerByte*)
- *governance action deposit* (*govDeposit*)

###### Guardrails

PARAM-03 (y)  Critical protocol  parameters require an SPO vote in addition
to a DRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than
50% of all active block production stake.
This is enforced by the guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.

PARAM-04 (x)  At least 3 months **should** normally pass between
the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a
critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding
on-chain governance action.
This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2
network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System

- *delegation key Lovelace deposit* (*stakeAddressDeposit*)
- *pool registration Lovelace deposit* (*stakePoolDeposit*)
- *minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (*minPoolCost*)
- *DRep deposit amount* (*dRepDeposit*)
- *minimal Constitutional Committee size* (*committeeMinSize*)
- *maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members*
(*committeeMaxTermLimit*)

###### Guardrails

PARAM-05 (y)  DReps **must** vote "yes" with a collective support of more than
50% of all active voting stake.
This is enforced by the guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

PARAM-06 (x)  At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the
publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical
to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain
governance action.
This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2
network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

#### 2.2 Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem;
2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the
Cardano Blockchain;
3. Ensure that Ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake
in constructive ways, including when delegating ada for block production; and
4. Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem
stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, Ada holders,
DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g. DApps)
and financial intermediaries (e.g. exchanges)

##### Triggers for Change

1. Significant changes in the fiat value of Ada resulting in
potential problems with security, performance or functionality
2. Changes in transaction volumes or types
3. Community requests or suggestions
4. Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters

##### Counter-indicators

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation.
They need to account for:

- External economic factors
- Network security concerns

##### Core Metrics

- Fiat value of Ada resulting in potential problems with security,
performance or functionality
- Transaction volumes and types
- Number and health of stake pools
- External economic factors

#### Changes to Specific Economic Parameters

##### Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

*fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)*

###### Guardrails

TFPB-01 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada)
This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFPB-02 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada)
This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFPB-03 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be negative

TFF-01 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be lower than 100,000  (0.1 ada)
This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFF-02 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** exceed 10,000,000 (10 ada)
This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFF-03 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be negative

TFGEN-01 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against
denial-of-service attacks, *txFeeFixed* and *txFeeFixed* **should** be adjusted
whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted
(executionUnitPrices[steps/memory])

TFGEN-02 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to  *txFeeFixed* or *txFeeFixed*
**must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a
denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that
it becomes impossible to construct a transaction.

##### UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)

Defines the cost for storage in UTxOs

- Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
(~1 ada minimum, could be >= 50 ada in the worst case)
- Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage.
This attack has been executed on other chains - it is not theoretical.
DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory
(proportional to UTxO growth)
- Helps reduce long term storage costs
- Provides an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed.
Should significantly exceed minimum tx cost (~ 0.15 ada)

###### Guardrails

UCPB-01 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be lower than 3,000 (0.003 ada)

UCPB-02 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** exceed 6,500 (0.0065 ada)

UCPB-03 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be zero

UCPB-04 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be negative

UCPB-05 (x - "should") Changes **should** account for
i) The acceptable cost of attack
ii) The acceptable time for an attack (at least one epoch is assumed)
iii) The acceptable memory configuration for full node users
(assumed to be 16GB for wallets or 24GB for stake pools)
iv) The sizes of UTxOs (~200B per UTxO minimum, up to about 10KB) and
v) The current total node memory usage

##### Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed

- Helps reduce long term storage costs
- Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and
memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

###### Guardrails

SAD-01 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be lower than 1,000,000 (1 ada)

SAD-02 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** exceed 5,000,000 (5 ada)

SAD-03 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be negative

##### Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer
needed by them

- Helps reduce long term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources
are returned when they are no longer required.
Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of

2. Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including
payment transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts,
DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions

##### Triggers for Change

Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:

1. Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days)
2. Anticipated changes in traffic demands
3. Community requests

##### Counter-indicators

Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:

- Excessive block propagation delays
- Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume
- Scripts being unable to complete execution

##### Core Metrics

All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:

- Block propagation delay profile
- Traffic volume (block size over time)
- Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)
- Script execution cost benchmarks
- Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes
on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment.
The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed,
including normal transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

### 4 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON HARD FORK INITIATION ACTIONS

The **hard fork initiation** action requires both a new major and a new minor
protocol version to be specified.

- As positive integers

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be
introduced.
Guardrails may be defined for these parameters,
which will take effect following the hard fork.
Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be deprecated by the hard fork,
in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.

###### Guardrails

HARDFORK-01 (~ - no access to existing parameter values)
The major protocol version **must** be the same as or one greater than
the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.
If the major protocol version is one greater,
then the minor protocol version **must** be zero.

HARDFORK-02 (~ - no access to existing parameter values)
The minor protocol version **must** be no less than the minor version
that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.

HARDFORK-03 (~ - no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the
protocol versions (major or minor or both) **must** change.

HARDFORK-04 (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake **should** have
upgraded to a Cardano node version that is capable of processing
the rules associated with the new protocol version.

HARDFORK-05 (x) Any new updatable protocol parameters
that are introduced with a hard fork **must** be included in this Appendix
and suitable guardrails defined for those parameters.

HARDFORK-06 (x) Settings for any new protocol parameters
that are introduced with a hard fork
**must** be included in the appropriate Genesis file.

HARDFORK-07 (x) Any deprecated protocol parameters **must** be indicated
in this Appendix.

HARDFORK-08 (~ - no access to *Plutus cost model* parameters)
New Plutus versions **must** be supported by a
version-specific *Plutus cost model* that covers each primitive that is
available in the new Plutus version.

### 5 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON UPDATE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE OR THRESHOLD ACTIONS

**Update Constitutional Committee or Threshold** governance actions
may change the size, composition or required voting thresholds for the
Constitutional Committee

###### Guardrails

UPDATE-CC-01 (x)  **Update Constitutional Committee and/or threshold**
**and/or term** governance actions **must not** be ratified until Ada holders
have ratified through an on-chain governance action the Final Constitution.

### 6 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON NEW CONSTITUTION OR GUARDRAILS SCRIPT ACTIONS

New constitution or guardrails script actions change the hash of the
on-chain constitution and the associated guardrails script.

###### Guardrails

NEW-CONSTITUTION-01 (x)  An **New Constitution**
**or Guardrails Script** governance action **must** be submitted to define
any required guardrails for new parameters that are introduced
via a Hard Fork governance action

### 7 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON NO CONFIDENCE ACTIONS

**No confidence** actions signal a state of no confidence
in the governance system.
No guardrails are imposed on **No Confidence** actions.

###### Guardrails

- None

### 8 GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON INFO ACTIONS

**Info** actions are not enacted on chain.
No guardrails are imposed on **Info** actions.

###### Guardrails

- None

### 9 GUARDRAILS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD

Interim Period

The Interim Period begins with the Chang Hard-Fork and ends after
a community-ratified Final Constitution is enacted on-chain.
Throughout the Interim Period, technical and constitution-enforced triggers
will progressively turn on the features of CIP-1694.

Interim Period Technical Rollout:

- The Chang Hard Fork will enable three initial CIP-1694 governance actions
and enable the representative framework to be established.
These actions are the **"Info"**, **"Hard-fork initiation"** and
**"Protocol parameter changes"** actions.
Ada holders will be able to register as and delegate to DReps immediately after
the hard fork but, as described in CIP-1694, DRep voting will not be available,
except on **"Info"** actions.
This ensures that Ada holders have sufficient time to choose
their voting delegations.
SPOs will be able to vote as described in CIP-1694.
**"Hard-fork initiation"** and **"Protocol parameter changes"** actions
will also be ratified by the Constitutional Committee.
Ada holders will be able to withdraw their staking rewards as usual.

- A subsequent hard fork, ratified by the Constitutional Committee and SPOs,
shortly after the Chang Hard Fork, will enable the four remaining
CIP-1694 governance actions: **"treasury withdrawals"**,
**"motion of no-confidence"**,
**"update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
**"new constitution or guardrails script"**.
At this point, DRep voting will be enabled and staking rewards can only be
withdrawn if the Ada holder has delegated their vote
(including to the pre-defined Abstain/No Confidence voting options).

###### Guardrails

INTERIM-01 (x) To provide sufficient time for DReps to register and
campaign and for Ada holders to choose their initial voting delegations,
at least 18 epochs (90 days, or approximately 3 months) **must** elapse after
the Chang hard fork before the subsequent hard fork can be ratified.
Once the subsequent hard fork is enacted, DRep voting can occur
as described in CIP-1694.

INTERIM-02 (x) Treasury withdrawals **must not** be ratified until there is
a community-approved Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget then in effect pursuant
to a previous on-chain governance action.

INTERIM-03 (x) Treasury withdrawals **must** be consistent with the
community-approved Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget(s).

INTERIM-04 (x) Ada holders **must** have ratified the Final Constitution
as specified in Appendix II before ratifying any other proposed
**"new constitution"**, **"update constitutional committee**
**and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
**"motion of no-confidence"** governance actions.

INTERIM-05 (x)  **"New guardrails script"** actions
that are consistent with the Interim Constitution may be ratified during
the interim period, provided the Interim Constitution itself is not changed.
